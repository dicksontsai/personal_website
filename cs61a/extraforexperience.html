<h2>My motivation for this section</h2>
<p>During discussion, and from the various survey responses, I found that some students may need additional challenging material to continue staying engaged in the course, e.g. those that finish the discussion problems more quickly than the rest of the section. I hope to include more examples here to keep students entertained, challenged, and working harder.</p>
<p>This material is *completely optional*. You do not have to try this material to get a good grade in this class: as long as you have a trememdous mastery of the basic principles and a well-developed intuition for applying these principles from practice, you will do well. This material allows for people to continue practicing once they have exhausted the original given problems.</p>
