<p>Hi! I am Dickson Tsai, a second-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley. My <a href="/projects">projects</a> center around problems I or other people encounter, but I did fun things as well, such as a <a href="http://github.com/dicksontsai/sudoku">Sudoku solver</a> my roommate and I casually competed to create one summer weekend. (I was tired that weekend, so my code was sloppier than I intended.) In my free time, I like to practice my Spanish at websites such as <a href="http://elpais.com">El Pais</a> and also <a href="http://practicaespanol.com">Practica Espa√±ol</a>. My past activities include being a sports editor for <a href="http://elestoque.org">El Estoque</a>, Monta Vista High School&#8217;s newspaper, which was how I learned a little bit of the Adobe suite, and playing the double bass.</p>

<p>On a separate note, I love great photos, especially those of landscapes or cityscapes, even though I am pretty bad at photography. Our world is one to appreciate and experience, which is my my website is full of photos I have taken during my travels. My banner photos are mostly taken from my trip to Spain with <a href="http://magellanstudyabroad.com">Magellan Study Abroad</a>. I will upload my trip journal at some point, along with a more complete collection of pictures.</p>

<li class="fact"> I used to be a grammar stickler, but not anymore. As all linguists know, every dialect is worth studying, and personally I think that as long as you can communicate your ideas, perfect grammar is not necessary. Of course, academic writing is very different from personal interaction, so you would be expected to write perfectly in the former but should not be expected to speak perfectly in the latter.</li>
<li class="fact"> More to come!</li>
